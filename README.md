```bash
# All public channels worldwide (~10,000+)
iptv --url "https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/index.m3u"

# By country
iptv --url "https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/us.m3u"
iptv --url "https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/ca.m3u"

# By category
iptv --url "https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/categories/news.m3u"
iptv --url "https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/categories/sports.m3u"

# By language
iptv --url "https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/languages/eng.m3u"
```

> Browse all available playlists at [iptv-org/iptv](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/blob/master/PLAYLISTS.md)

### Basic

```bash
# Local M3U file
iptv --playlist /path/to/playlist.m3u

# Remote M3U URL
iptv --url "https://your-provider.com/playlist.m3u"

# Xtream Codes provider
iptv --xtream-server "http://provider.com:8080" --xtream-user myuser --xtream-pass mypass
```

### With EPG Guide

```bash
iptv --url "https://your-provider.com/playlist.m3u" --epg "https://your-provider.com/epg.xml"
```

### HDHomeRun Mode (for Plex/Jellyfin)

```bash
iptv --url "https://your-provider.com/playlist.m3u" \
     --epg "https://your-provider.com/epg.xml" \
     --hdhr-port 5004 \
     --buffer ffmpeg \
     --hdhr-buffer-secs 3
```

Then in Plex: **Settings → Live TV & DVR → Set Up** → enter `http://<your-ip>:5004` as the tuner URL, and `http://<your-ip>:5004/xmltv.xml` as the guide source.

Your curated playlist is also available at `http://<your-ip>:5004/playlist.m3u` for use with any M3U-compatible player.

### Auto-Refresh

```bash
# Refresh playlist + EPG every 6 hours
iptv --url "https://your-provider.com/playlist.m3u" \
     --epg "https://your-provider.com/epg.xml" \
     --refresh-hours 6
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests — all appreciated.

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repo and clone your fork
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. Make your changes and ensure they compile: `cargo build`
4. Run clippy: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
5. Commit with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "feat: add my feature"`
6. Push and open a PR against `main`

### Guidelines

- **Keep PRs focused** — one feature or fix per PR
- **Follow existing patterns** — look at how similar features are implemented
- **Test with real data** — try your changes with a large playlist (iptv-org works great)
- **No unsafe code** unless absolutely necessary and well-justified
- **Commit messages** — use conventional format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, etc.

### Ideas for Contribution

Check the [issues](https://github.com/nschnarr/iptv-tui-player/issues) for open tasks. Some areas that could use help:

- Multi-provider support (merge multiple playlists)
- TMDB metadata integration
- Watch history tracking
